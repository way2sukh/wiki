## Methods Common to All Objects
Although `Object` is a concrete class, it is designed primarily for extension. All of its nonfinal methods (`equals, hashCode, toString, clone, and finalize`) have explicit general contracts because they are designed to be overridden. It is the responsibility of any class overriding these methods to obey their general contracts; failure to do so will prevent other classes that depend on the contracts (such as HashMap and HashSet) from functioning properly in conjunction with the class.
